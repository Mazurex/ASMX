#### Comparison Operators

A comparion operator returns a boolean value depending on the operator.

A comparison operator accepts **2** numeric parameters:

- `x`
- `y`

Ensure `x` and `y` are of the **NotNull Int** or **NotNull Double** datatypes.

There are **6** comparison operators:

1. `x > y` - Greater than
2. `x < y` - Less than
3. `x == y` - Equal
4. `x != y` - Not equal
5. `x >= y` - More than or equal
6. `x <= y` - Less than or equal

##### Examples:

`Bool greater_than = x > y`
Will return true if the value of `x` is **greater** than the value of `y`.
`Bool less_than = x < y`
Will return true if the value of `x` is **less** than the value of `y`.
`Bool equal = x == y`
Will return true if the value of `x` is **equal** to the value of `y`.
`Bool not_equal = x != y`
Will return true if the value of `x` is **not equal** to the value of `y`.
`Bool more_than_or_equal = x >= y`
Will return true if the value of `x` is **more than** or **equal** to the value of `y`.
`Bool less_than_or_equal = x <= y`
Will return true if the value of `x` is **less than** or **equal** to the value of `y`.

#### Condition Operators

A condition operator allows the merging and inverting of given **comparison operators**.

There are **3** condition operators:

1. `&& (and)` - **True** if **both** comparion operators are **True**.
2. `|| (or)` - **True** if **any** comparion operators are **True**.
3. `not` - Inverts boolean, **True** into **False**, and vice versa.

##### Examples:

`Bool both_true = x > y && y == z`
Will return true if **both** comparion operators are true.
`Bool both_true = x > y || y == z`
Will return true if **any** comparion operators are true.
`Bool opposite = not x > y`
Will return true if comparison operator is **false**

You can also mix and match condition operators:
`Bool is_true = x > y && not x == z`
Will return true if `x` is more than `y` is **true** and `x` is equal to `z` is **false**

##### Direct Boolean Checking:

Booleans can be directly checked or explicitly compared:

1. `condition == true`
   Condition Operators default to true, meaning you do **not** have to specify you are checking for true.
2. `condition == false`
   This will check if condition is false.
3. `condition != true`
   This will check if condition is **not equal** to true (false)
